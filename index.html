      My first experience with coding was at university, where I created a WordPress website for my e-
shop. I really enjoyed the process of making it and then after some time, I started with an online
HTML and CSS course and immediately fell in love with it. My next step led me to PHP and from
there I decided to do a 3-month immersive course at General Assembly. It gave me a lot of
technical skills, a good understanding of the industry, and also group problem-solving
experiences.
I am looking to join a dynamic team where I can collaborate and grow alongside them. Learning
in a highly productive environment where everyone can support each other is my number one
priority. I welcome constructive criticism and I will do as much as I can to help the team to
achieve our goals.

              Individual project built in 7 days with Django Rest Framework on the back end, and React on the front. 
              Styling was done with SaSS and a little bit of Bulma.  I made a “virtual gym” social network.

              Group project of four, completed in 7 days, and build in MongoDB and React. It is a social network for houseplant-lovers. 
              Users can show their plants and swap plants with other users. It was a perfect experience of working in a group, dividing tasks, 
              planning, and working with a Git as a group.  My main responsibility was plant trading functionality in back end and front end.
               I was also doing other social network functionalities and part of the styling which was done with SaSS and Bulma.
